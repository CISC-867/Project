# Reproducing Unsupervised Synthesis of Audio via Exemplar Encoders

This repository is the official implementation of our Reproducibility Paper for CISC 867

## Requirements

The implementation requires tensorflow, pandas, numpy, IPython and matplotlib.
To install requirements:
```setup
pip install numpy tensorflow pandas IPython matplotlib
```
## Training

To train the model in the our paper, run all cells in [CISC867Project.ipynb](https://github.com/CISC-867/Project/blob/master/CISC867Project.ipynbhttps://github.com/CISC-867/Project/blob/master/CISC867Project.ipynb).
